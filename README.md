This project is being developed as part of a college-level hackathon with the aim of saving valuable time for students by providing a centralized platform that lists private, government, and international opportunities — all in one place.

Initially designed for Indian students who are currently pursuing or have completed their bachelor’s or master’s degrees, the platform helps them easily discover relevant job and internship opportunities without the hassle of browsing multiple sites.
